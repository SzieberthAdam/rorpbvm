<h3>4. OTHER SCENARIOS</h3>
<p>The purpose of separating the cards by type was to allow players more 
flexibility to create the setups they like. For example you can use Temporary 
decks to shuffle for example 6-6 cards from Early and Middle Republic decks 
together and place them between the two scenarios which results some overlapping 
between the two.</p>
<p>I recommend to keep those cards (6-6 cards, and the next scenario cards 
separated) in different temporary decks (you can even use temporary senators and 
red decks for that) othewise when a card returns to the Deck (usually a War or a 
Leader) then becomes very hard to keep the structure of the main Deck. The only 
downside then that you will notice that part of the game when the main deck gets 
empty. But that is even better than going through all cards one by one, 
separating them by eras, and recreating the whole main deck. Not to mention that 
red cards in opponent hands may become common knowledge.</p>
<p>I let you to discover how to create other setups, including the optional 
ones.</p>

<h3>5. OPTIONAL RULES</h3>
<p>Most of the optional rules does not need anything with the module, but some 
does. Technically I needed to separate them:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Markers are in the markers panel under the optional rules tab. 
  <li>Those which change the text of the cards are on the toolbar, and you can 
  activate and deactivate them.</li></ul>
<p>You can find more informations about the optional rules in the Help section.</p>
